To connect machine learning model to frontend using flask
Flask - web micro framework
Django - web application framework similar to MVC model
Built on Jinga2 template rendering machine and  werkzerg WSGI Webserver Gateway Interface toolkit

app.py contains routes for each web page
model.py containes machine learning algorithm implementation
static folder - html,javascript,css,images
It is difficult to train model everytime so trained model can be saved using pickle and joblib
We can use pickle,joblib for saving model object
pickle file - to save the model
pickle is used to serialize and deserialize python objects like list,tuples,dict to binary values
joblib - serializing object using numpy array
